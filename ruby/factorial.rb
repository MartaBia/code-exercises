# Write a Ruby function that, given an integer n, returns
# the factorial of that number.
# Return nil if the input n is invalid.
# Be aware that by definition, 0! = 1.
#
# Examples:
# factorial(0) => 1
# factorial(1) => 1
# factorial(2) => 2
# factorial(3) => 6
# factorial(4) => 24
# factorial(5) => 120
# factorial(-5) => -120
# factorial("lol") => nil
