# Write a Ruby function called nth_tribonacci that, given a positive integer n,
# returns n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence (where the first
# three elements of the sequence are 0, 0 and 1, respectively).
# The Tribonacci sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence where each
# element is given by the sum of the previous three in the sequence.
# Return nil if the input n is invalid.
#
# Examples:
# nth_tribonacci(0) => []
# nth_tribonacci(1) => [0]
# nth_tribonacci(2) => [0, 0]
# nth_tribonacci(3) => [0, 0, 1]
# nth_tribonacci(7) => [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7]
# nth_tribonacci(-3) => []
# nth_tribonacci("asd") => []
