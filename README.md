# Code Exercises

This repository contains a collection of the first code exercises that I've completed as part of my journey to become a software developer.

## Languages

The exercises in this repository are primarily written in two programming languages: 

| **Language** |                |     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --- |
| **Python**             | <img height="30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183423507-c056a6f9-1ba8-4312-a350-19bcbc5a8697.png" alt="Python" title="Python" />| Python was the first language I studied. I found it to be a great introduction to programming. |
| **Ruby**                 | <img height="30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/192603745-7d34df9e-7756-4756-a539-6a61badf7a80.png" alt="Ruby" title="Ruby" />  | After gaining some experience with Python, I started to learn Ruby in preparation for Makers Bootcamp |

Many of the exercises in this repository are written in Ruby, as I've been using it extensively in my studies.

## Exercises

The exercises in this repository cover a variety of programming concepts, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. Some of the exercises are small and straightforward, while others are more complex and require more advanced problem-solving skills. Each exercise includes a description of the problem, as well as my solution to the problem.
