# Now that youâ€™re back to school for another term, you need to remember how to work the combination lock on your locker.
# The lock has a dial with 40 calibration marks numbered 0 to 39 in clockwise order.
# A combination of this lock consists of 3 of these numbers; for example: 15-25-8.

# To open the lock, the following steps are taken:

# 1. Turn the dial clockwise 2 full turns
# 2. Continue turning clockwise until the 1st number is reached
# 3. Turn the dial counter-clockwise 1 full turn
# 4. Continue turning counter-clockwise until the 2nd number is reached
# 5. Turn the dial clockwise again until the 3rd number is reached
# 6. Pull the shank and the lock will open.

# Given the initial position of the dial and the combination for the lock,
# how many degrees is the dial rotated in total (clockwise plus counter-clockwise) in opening the lock?

    total_degrees = 1080

        total_degrees += (first - initial) * 9
        print(f'total degrees: {total_degrees}')
    else:

    if first > second:
        total_degrees += (first - second) * 9
        print(f'total degrees: {total_degrees}')
    else:
        total_degrees += (40 - (first - second)) * 9

    if second < third:
        print(f'total degrees: {total_degrees}')
        total_degrees += (third - second) * 9
