# In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:

# >>> d = Dictionary()

# >>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')

# >>> print(d.look('Apple'))
# A fruit that grows on trees

# >>> print(d.look('Banana'))
# Can't find entry for Banana

class Dictionary():
    def __init__(self):
        self.dictionary = {}

    def newentry(self, word, definition):
        self.dictionary[word] = definition

    def look(self, key):
        if key in self.dictionary:
            return self.dictionary[key]
        else:
            return (f"Can't find entry for {key}")


d = Dictionary()

d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')

print(d.look('Apple'))
# A fruit that grows on trees

print(d.look('Banana'))
# # Can't find entry for Banana
